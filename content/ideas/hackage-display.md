title: Rewrite Browse and Search pages for Hackage, implement new ranking
---

The browse and search interfaces of hackage (e.g. https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/browse) are both very powerful, but somewhat outdated and unwieldy. The table browser used is an old javascript library and cannot display data incrementally until the full content is loaded. A newer interface that pulled tabular data via xhttp requests from an API-generated JSON file or the like could begin incremental display (especially when paged) well before all data was loaded. Further, it would be good to allow custom filtering of the pages (i.e. exclusion of deprecated packages, low rating packages, etc), reordering and hiding or showing of columns, and persistence of such preferences in the users' local js storage. As a whole, information density could be improved, and additional columns such as latest-upload-version and latest-base-(or ghc)-supported. Along with that, implementation of PackageRank as a possible sorting metric (https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/issues/986) could be useful.
